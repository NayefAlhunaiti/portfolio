Practical projects with clear setup. 
This repo lists my small apps, demos, and tools — each project lives in its own repository with its own README, CI, and issue tracker. Use PROJECTS.md to find quick start instructions, demos, and tech details and credentials with provided certifications.
B. A personal showcase of apps, utilities, and experiments built while learning and solving problems. Each entry links to a dedicated repo with code, instructions, and screenshots so you can try or contribute easily
